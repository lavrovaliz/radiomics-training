# radiomics-training
 A very basic example of Radiomics pipeline, demonstrating the main steps of radiomic analysis: looking at the DICOM parameters, data conversion, exploratory features analysis, feature extraction and selection, model training and testing. To start, clone or download this repo to your computer. You need to have Python 3 (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/install) installed. You can find the Jupyter script with a pipeline in 'src' folder. The 'data' folder is for the imaging data and accompanying clinical data, the 'results' folder is for all the documents generated while executing the script.
